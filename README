This repository contains the PCB design and firmware for
a stanalone position sensor for use with the VIVE VR system.

 * 4 sensors, 30 positions/s each
 * Totally standalone, works out lighthouse positions for itself
 * No configuration, apply power... get position data
 * Accounts for gravity direction using accelerometer data from lighthouses
 * Output sent via USB serial and/or UART
 * Running on a 20MHz AVR

How to use:

1) Manufacture the board that can be found in the 'board' directory 
   (CADSoft Eagle format).
2) Edit Makefile and change paths to tools:
   CCDEVS, CCINC, CC, OBJCOPY, OBJDUMP
3) Run 'make' to build the firmware
4) Write firmware to board, e.g.:
   avrdude -c jtag2updi -P /dev/ttyACM1 -p m3209 -U flash:w:image.hex
5) Connect USB (or power+UART) to board
6) The board should start outputing position data shortly after
   the lighthouses become visible to it.
7) Use the solve-lighthouse.py script to pretty print the data stream:
   ./solve-lighthouse.py --dump-pos --dump-sensor=0 /dev/ttyACM0
